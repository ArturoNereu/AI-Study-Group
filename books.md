## Books

Here are the books I've read to make sense of AI/ML/DL. Some are more technical, some are more theoretical, and some are more ideas.

They are not in any particular order, although I tried to group them together based on what I think makes sense.

- [Hands-On Large Language Models: Language Understanding and Generation](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-large-language/9781098150952/) Building an LLM from scratch is difficult, even understanding existing open-source options can be challenging. This book does a great job of explaining how LLMs work and introduces common architectures at a deep enough level to be practical without being overwhelming.
- [AI Engineering: Building Applications with Foundation Models](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-engineering/9781098166298/) If you feel lost and don't know where to start, this book can serve as a great map. Chip explains the most common concepts behind AI in a clear and approachable way.
- [Deep Learning - A Visual Approach](https://www.glassner.com/portfolio/deep-learning-a-visual-approach/) Probably the best resource out there for building solid intuition about the many concepts surrounding deep learning. Andrew, the author, did a wonderful job illustrating these concepts, making it much easier to develop a real understanding of them.
- [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) The most complete and in-depth book on Deep Learning. It's dense but thorough, covering the math, statistics, and core algorithms that form the foundation of modern AI. It helped me build a clearer mental model of the tools used in research and implementation. I posted a video with my raw thoughts on the book. [Deep Learning](https://youtu.be/DtOQ6zcgqfY?si=PHYL4q5rMaCF-gEW)
- [What is Intelligence](https://whatisintelligence.antikythera.org/) This book brings in many notes, ideas, and discoveries around intelligence. Topics covered: evolution, biology, neurology, psychology, computer science, language, chemistry, and phyics. It sparked many ideas in my mind that I will start exploring in my research. Also, you can find some explorations of how other animals, plants, insects, bacteria, express their intelligence and how we can take inspiration to building AI. The book is available online, for free, with printed versions available too.
- [Practical Deep Learning: A Python-Based Introduction](https://nostarch.com/practical-deep-learning-python) Probably the best resource for balancing deep learning concepts with a hands-on, Python-based approach. It's much easier to follow if you actively implement the code, even if that just means typing out the examples from the book.
- [Hands-On Generative AI with Transformers and Diffusion Models](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-generative-ai/9781098149239/) This book provides a panoramic view of different model types to generate images, audio, and text. It shows a lot of code, and comes with challenges that are interesting to tackle if you want to get hands-on experience. Omar(one of the authors) is an ex-Hugging Face, now working at Google Deep Mind.
- [Dive Into Data Science: Use Python To Tackle Your Toughest Business Challenges](https://nostarch.com/dive-data-science) Not strictly about AI, although if you think about it, AI is deeply tied to data science. This book is great for understanding real-world scenarios and how to approach them using AI tools and Python. For me, the data preparation part was especially helpful.
- [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/index.html) An amazing free book that covers the fundamental concepts of deep learning, including how to build your own models from scratch. It leans toward the heavier side, but it comes with plenty of Jupyter notebooks you can run to test your understanding. I still can't believe this resource is free.
- [Grokking Deep Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning) When I read this book, I had a lot of "aha" moments. I'm not sure if it was the clarity of the explanations or the fact that I already had some background from other books, but either way, the examples and explanations are excellent. It strikes a good balance between theory, algorithms, and practical implementation.
- [Prompt Engineering for LLMs](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/prompt-engineering-for/9781098156145/) This book provides useful tips and tricks to program using LLMs, essentially via prompts. As of 2025, I think the techniques discussed here, can be very useful for people using LLMs as part of their programming stack.
- [Math for Deep Learning: A Practitioner's Guide to Mastering Neural Networks](https://nostarch.com/math-deep-learning) If you're interested in how AI works under the hood, it ultimately comes down to a lot of math. This book does a great job explaining the essential mathematics behind implementing neural networks. It can feel overwhelming at times. The book is incredibly helpful for understanding how popular frameworks work, and how to better evaluate them for your use cases.
- [Why Machines Learn: The Elegant Math Behind Modern AI](https://anilananthaswamy.com/why-machines-learn) A fascinating mix of math and history that explores how we arrived at large language models (LLMs) today (2024). I recommend reading it after you've built some basic math foundations — you'll find it much more helpful that way.
- [Understanding Deep Learning](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/) Another amazing book, and it's completely free! (But buy it if you can). This book puts special focus on the pedagogy of how to learn (and teach) deep learning. It also comes with interactive notebooks so you can try out the explanations yourself.
- [Practical Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD](https://course.fast.ai/Resources/book.html) This book comes with video lectures by [Jeremy Howard](https://x.com/jeremyphoward), the author and creator of FastAI. The goal is to give coders a head start in deep learning without diving too deep into the weeds. It still covers how to achieve a lot using the FastAI framework and PyTorch. Having the videos included made it especially cool, since I could both listen to and watch the author explain the concepts.
- [Natural Language Processing with Transformers: Building Language Applications with Hugging Face](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098136789/) This book is a great introduction to NLP in the context of the 🤗 Transformers library. The explanations, and the fact that most of them come with code — enhance the learning experience. It covers everything from getting started to training and evaluating your own custom NLP model.
- [The Shape of Data: Geometry-Based Machine Learning and Data Analysis in R](https://nostarch.com/shapeofdata) When I got to this book, I already had a decent understanding of machine learning. Reading its geometric approach(spatial, geometrical, and visual rather than only statistical) gave me many moments where I smiled, things made sense even when framed through a different paradigm. I do wish the code examples weren't in R, but I still managed to follow the concepts easily.
- [The Art of Machine Learning: A Hands-On Guide to Machine Learning with R](https://nostarch.com/art-machine-learning) I would recommend this book to anyone who is already familiar with R or wants to learn both R and machine learning together. It's a quick read.
- [How AI Works: From Sorcery to Science](https://nostarch.com/how-ai-works) I recommend this book if you don't want to code or dive into the technical details of AI, deep learning, or machine learning, but still want a high-level understanding of what it's all about. It's great for people in non-engineering or non-technical roles. The book gives clear explanations of how things work without getting lost in the weeds.
- [The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data](https://mitpressbookstore.mit.edu/book/9781541618510) Deep Learning is heavily based on statistics, and while this book doesn't focus on AI, everything inside, from the math to the advice on how to use data, is very relevant to people wanting to get involved in modern AI.
- [Architecting Data and Machine Learning Platforms](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/architecting-data-and/9781098151607/) Less about ML/DL/AI, but useful to understand what is required to deploy solutions to support data analysis and deployment at large scale, in the cloud. Interesting strategies for deploying, managing and migrating ML projects in the cloud.
- [Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/superintelligence-9780198739838) This was the first non-technical book I read on AI. It was fascinating because it offered a glimpse into the broader implications of what we're building. I don't think everything predicted in the book will happen, but it presents great perspectives on how to mitigate potential risks.
- [The Myth of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674278660) This book offers the perspective that artificial intelligence won't become the powerful, dangerous new form of life many imagine. It provides solid arguments for why that is, presenting a view that is much less apocalyptic than what you usually hear.
- [The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn](https://gwern.net/doc/science/1997-hamming-theartofdoingscienceandengineering.pdf) While this book is not about AI specifically, Hamming covers what he thought AI would evolve into (which it kind of did) in chapters 6, 7, and 8. Even with what we are now capable of doing, he doesn't think we need fewer programmers — just smarter ones. And that we should focus on what problems to solve, and why. Also, his in-person classes are available in [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/the-art-of-doing-science-and-engineering).
- [The Coming Wave: Technology, Power, and the Twenty-first Century's Greatest Dilemma](https://the-coming-wave.com/) This book explores more catastrophic scenarios. Scenarios that, in my opinion, are entirely feasible. The book warns how the AI race could go wrong. It highlights not just the risks from machines themselves, but also the dangers of powerful tools falling into the wrong hands.
- [A Brief History of Intelligence: Evolution, AI, and the Five Breakthroughs That Made Our Brains](https://www.abriefhistoryofintelligence.com/book) This book serves as a map for understanding intelligence, mostly through an evolutionary lens. It’s one of the most comprehensive and direct references I’ve seen on the topic, with plenty of ideas that can inspire how we think about building artificial intelligence systems and models. The author focuses on five key breakthroughs that shaped the human brain into what it is today: steering, reinforcing, simulating, mentalizing, and speaking.
- [The Third Chimpanzee](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/220289/the-third-chimpanzee-by-jared-diamond/) This book explores how humans evolved into the ‘third chimpanzee,’ offering lessons for AI developers and designers. From human history and animal behavior, there are patterns we can reflect on. AI won’t be a mammal, so it’s not a ‘fourth chimpanzee,’ but because we are creating it, we should use past lessons to build something beneficial for ourselves and others.
- [The Chaos Machine](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/max-fisher/the-chaos-machine/9780316703307/) The book shows how many of social media’s problems arose from AI optimizing too narrowly toward specific goals. These examples can serve as warnings as we design chatbots and GPT-style systems.
- [Ways of Being: Animals, Plants, Machines: The Search for a Planetary Intelligence](https://draw-down.com/products/animals-plants-machines-the-search-for-a-planetary-intelligence) This book explores not just artificial intelligence, but the many forms of intelligence that already exist alongside us on Earth. It’s a great source of inspiration and a reminder that intelligence comes in many shapes, most of which we don't understand.
- [Your Brain Is a Time Machine: The Neuroscience and Physics of Time](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393355604) AI-adjacent, but this book provides an interesting view of how our brains handle time, and how we can bring in ideas to the world of neural networks, as I believe there are untapped opportunities to allow AIs to make better use of the concept and perception of time, particularly when dealing with memory and planning.
- [Everything Is Predictable: How Bayesian Statistics Explain Our World](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/199798096-everything-is-predictable) This book provides a compelling view at how everything in life can be predicted, which essentially is what we are making machines do. Predict data.
- [The Origin of Language: How We Learned to Speak and Why](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220161181-the-origin-of-language) The second half of the book is the part that covers language (the first part is mostly about animal evolution). I found some interesting concepts such as: language as a virus, what language unlocked for humans (being able to organize), and a bit of how synthetic language(AI) compares to our human-language.
- [Inteligência Artificial em Educação Matemática](https://www.grupoautentica.com.br/produto/inteligencia-artificial-em-educacao-matematica-1765)  interesting take from Brazilian educators on how to use AI (mostly LLMs) in teaching mathematics. These guides are useful not just for people building AI, but for anyone who needs reference material to understand both the power and the limitations of generative models. The fact that this comes from Brazil also brings a perspective that’s often missing in AI-focused literature.
