## Papers

At the core of most AI advances is research — deep, complex work published by people pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. These breakthroughs often appear in the form of academic papers.
Reading papers can be overwhelming at first. It’s not always easy to unpack their meaning or follow the math. I suggest using tools like [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/) or joining a local AI paper-reading club.
