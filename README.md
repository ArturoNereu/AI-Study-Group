## Books
<img src="./Illustrations/Characters/NI_Cool.png" alt="NI Cool" align="right" width="200px">

Here are the books I've read to make sense of AI/ML/DL. Some are more technical, some are more theoretical, and some are more ideas.

They are not in any particular order, although I tried to group them together based on what i think makes sense.

- [Deep Learning - A Visual Approach](https://www.glassner.com/portfolio/deep-learning-a-visual-approach/) Probably the best resource out there for building solid intuition about the many concepts surrounding deep learning. Andrew, the author, did a wonderful job illustrating these concepts, making it much easier to develop a real understanding of them.
- [Practical Deep Learning: A Python-Based Introduction](https://nostarch.com/practical-deep-learning-python) Probably the best resource for balancing deep learning concepts with a hands-on, Python-based approach. It‚Äôs much easier to follow if you actively implement the code, even if that just means typing out the examples from the book.
- [Dive Into Data Science: Use Python To Tackle Your Toughest Business Challenges](https://nostarch.com/dive-data-science) Not strictly about AI, although if you think about it, AI is deeply tied to data science. This book is great for understanding real-world scenarios and how to approach them using AI tools and Python. For me, the data preparation part was especially helpful.
- [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/index.html) An amazing free book that covers the fundamental concepts of deep learning, including how to build your own models from scratch. It leans toward the heavier side, but it comes with plenty of Jupyter notebooks you can run to test your understanding. I still can‚Äôt believe this resource is free.
- [Grokking Deep Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning) When I read this book, I had a lot of ‚Äúaha‚Äù moments. I‚Äôm not sure if it was the clarity of the explanations or the fact that I already had some background from other books, but either way, the examples and explanations are excellent. It strikes a good balance between theory, algorithms, and practical implementation.
- [Math for Deep Learning: A Practitioner's Guide to Mastering Neural Networks](https://nostarch.com/math-deep-learning) If you‚Äôre interested in how AI works under the hood, it ultimately comes down to a lot of math. This book does a great job explaining the essential mathematics behind implementing neural networks. It can feel overwhelming at times. The book is incredibly helpful for understanding how popular frameworks work, and how to better evaluate them for your use cases.
- [Why Machines Learn: The Elegant Math Behind Modern AI](https://anilananthaswamy.com/why-machines-learn) A fascinating mix of math and history that explores how we arrived at large language models (LLMs) today (2024). I recommend reading it after you‚Äôve built some basic math foundations ‚Äî you‚Äôll find it much more helpful that way. 
- [Understanding Deep Learning](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/) Another amazing book, and it‚Äôs completely free! (But buy it if you can). This book puts special focus on the pedagogy of how to learn (and teach) deep learning. It also comes with interactive notebooks so you can try out the explanations yourself.
- [Practical Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD](https://course.fast.ai/Resources/book.html) This book comes with video lectures by [Jeremy Howard](https://x.com/jeremyphoward), the author and creator of FastAI. The goal is to give coders a head start in deep learning without diving too deep into the weeds. It still covers how to achieve a lot using the FastAI framework and PyTorch. Having the videos included made it especially cool, since I could both listen to and watch the author explain the concepts.
- [The Shape of Data: Geometry-Based Machine Learning and Data Analysis in R]()
- [The Art of Machine Learning: A Hands-On Guide to Machine Learning with R]()
- [How AI Works: From Sorcery to Science](https://nostarch.com/how-ai-works) I recommend this book if you don‚Äôt want to code or dive into the technical details of AI, deep learning, or machine learning, but still want a high-level understanding of what it‚Äôs all about. It‚Äôs great for people in non-engineering or non-technical roles. The book gives clear explanations of how things work without getting lost in the weeds.


- [Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies]()
- [The Myth of Artificial Intelligence]()
- [The Coming Wave: Technology, Power, and the Twenty-first Century's Greatest Dilemma]()
- [Ways of Being: Animals, Plants, Machines: The Search for a Planetary Intelligence]()
