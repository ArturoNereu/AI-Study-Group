## Books - Extras

To avoid bloating the books section in the [README](/README.md), I’m adding books adjacent to AI, which I see more as food for thought, or as ethical, political, and guidance works.

- [A Brief History of Intelligence: Evolution, AI, and the Five Breakthroughs That Made Our Brains](https://www.abriefhistoryofintelligence.com/book) This book serves as a map for understanding intelligence, mostly through an evolutionary lens. It’s one of the most comprehensive and direct references I’ve seen on the topic, with plenty of ideas that can inspire how we think about building artificial intelligence systems and models. The author focuses on five key breakthroughs that shaped the human brain into what it is today: steering, reinforcing, simulating, mentalizing, and speaking.

- [The Third Chimpanzee](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/220289/the-third-chimpanzee-by-jared-diamond/) This book explores how humans evolved into the ‘third chimpanzee,’ offering lessons for AI developers and designers. From human history and animal behavior, there are patterns we can reflect on. AI won’t be a mammal, so it’s not a ‘fourth chimpanzee,’ but because we are creating it, we should use past lessons to build something beneficial for ourselves and others.

- [The Chaos Machine](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/max-fisher/the-chaos-machine/9780316703307/) The book shows how many of social media’s problems arose from AI optimizing too narrowly toward specific goals. These examples can serve as warnings as we design chatbots and GPT-style systems.

- [Ways of Being: Animals, Plants, Machines: The Search for a Planetary Intelligence](https://draw-down.com/products/animals-plants-machines-the-search-for-a-planetary-intelligence) This book explores not just artificial intelligence, but the many forms of intelligence that already exist alongside us on Earth. It’s a great source of inspiration and a reminder that intelligence comes in many shapes, most of which we don't understand.

- [Your Brain Is a Time Machine: The Neuroscience and Physics of Time](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393355604) AI-adjacent, but this book provides an interesting view of how our brains handle time, and how we can bring in ideas to the world of neural networks, as I believe there are untapped opportunities to allow AIs to make better use of the concept and perception of time, particularly when dealing with memory and planning.

- [Everything Is Predictable: How Bayesian Statistics Explain Our World](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/199798096-everything-is-predictable) This book provides a compelling view at how everything in life can be predicted, which essentially is what we are making machines do. Predict data.

- [The Origin of Language: How We Learned to Speak and Why](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220161181-the-origin-of-language) The second half of the book is the part that covers language (the first part is mostly about animal evolution). I found some interesting concepts such as: language as a virus, what language unlocked for humans (being able to organize), and a bit of how synthetic language(AI) compares to our human-language.

- [Inteligência Artificial em Educação Matemática](https://www.grupoautentica.com.br/produto/inteligencia-artificial-em-educacao-matematica-1765)  interesting take from Brazilian educators on how to use AI (mostly LLMs) in teaching mathematics. These guides are useful not just for people building AI, but for anyone who needs reference material to understand both the power and the limitations of generative models. The fact that this comes from Brazil also brings a perspective that’s often missing in AI-focused literature.
