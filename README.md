Notes used to understand AI

## Books
Here are the books I've read to make sense of AI/ML/DL. Some are more technical, some are more theoretical, and some are more ideas.

- [Deep Learning - A Visual Approach](https://www.glassner.com/portfolio/deep-learning-a-visual-approach/) Probably the best resource out there to get a solid intuition about the many concepts surrounding Deep Learning.
- [Math for Deep Learning: A Practitioner's Guide to Mastering Neural Networks]()
- [Dive Into Data Science: Use Python To Tackle Your Toughest Business Challenges]()
- [Practical Deep Learning: A Python-Based Introduction]()
- [Grokking Deep Learning]()
- [The Shape of Data: Geometry-Based Machine Learning and Data Analysis in R]()
- [The Art of Machine Learning: A Hands-On Guide to Machine Learning with R]()
- [How AI Works: From Sorcery to Science]()
- [The Coming Wave: Technology, Power, and the Twenty-first Century's Greatest Dilemma]()
- [Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies]()
- [Ways of Being: Animals, Plants, Machines: The Search for a Planetary Intelligence]()
- [The Coming Wave: Technology, Power, and the Twenty-first Century's Greatest Dilemma]()
- [Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD](https://course.fast.ai/Resources/book.html)
- [Understanding Deep Learning](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/)
- [The Myth of Artificial Intelligence]()
- [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/index.html)
- [Why Machines Learn: The Elegant Math Behind Modern AI](https://anilananthaswamy.com/why-machines-learn) A fascinating mix of maths and history on how we got to LLMs today (2024). I suggest getting to this after learning some basic math first; you'll find it more helpful.

## Courses & Tutorials
- [Getting Started with Deep Learning](https://learn.nvidia.com/courses/course?course_id=course-v1:DLI+S-FX-01+V1) Short and to the point intro to Deep Learning. It comes with Jupyter notebooks for learning and assessing your skills.
- [MIT Intro to Deep Learning](http://introtodeeplearning.com/) FREE bootcamp by MIT researchers. It's ~10 hours of content covering the basic Deep Learning concepts.
- [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)
- [C++ Neural Network in a Weekend](https://www.jeremyong.com/cpp/machine-learning/2020/10/23/cpp-neural-network-in-a-weekend/)


## Videos & Talks
- [Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=2095s) Andrej Karpathy's step-by-step guide on building GPT. I watched this video, but his entire channel is pretty good.
